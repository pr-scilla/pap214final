# Priscilla Pierce Final Project Self Assessment, 8/27/2026

## Automate

**<span style="color:red">Not yet met - Need to work on first two bullet points under "The entire analysis is automated". Under "The analysis produces the expected output", I need to work on more style and formatting elements of the figure to make sure it looks similar to the original. </span>**

**The entire analysis is automated**

- Data reading and cleaning is handled in a standalone script that creates intermediate output(s).
- The analysis is performed in a Quarto document that reads intermediate outputs.
- Files in the R/ folder exclusively define functions and have no other side effects.
- All scripts run without errors.

**The analysis produces the expected output**

- The Quarto document performs the data analysis (moving average).
- The Quarto document creates a figure that is a reasonable approximation of the original.

## Organize

**<span style="color:red">Not yet met - Need to create Outputs folder to move code to from spaghetti code.  </span>**

**Data are properly organized**

- Raw data is contained in its own folder.
- Outputs are contained in a separate folder from raw data.

**Code is properly organized**

- At least one function is defined in a script in R/ and used elsewhere in the workflow.
- All code in the repo (except in the scratch/ folder) is required for the analysis (i.e., no “safety blanket” code remaining)

## Document

**<span style="color:red">Not yet met - README.md is currently effictive but will require updates once other changes from previous specs are made. Need to reveiw comments to make sure they are appropriate. </span>**

**The repo has an effective README**

A short, but descriptive title

- A README’s title is set to the repository name by default - change this!

A brief explanation of the repository’s purpose

- Paragraphs or a bulleted list are both acceptable options
- You may include an image or logo that represents the project

A concise description of what’s housed in the repository

- This includes information about the repository structure or file organization

Details regarding data access

- Any necessary information on where data lives (e.g. is it housed in the repo, on a server, in a library/package etc.) and how to access it in order to run the code

A list of authors or current contributors (for collaborative work)

- Consider hyperlinking collaborators’ GitHub profiles or other professional profile

References

- In an appropriate, consistent format, including links.
- Don’t forget to add references for datasets too.

**Code follows a professional style**

All code files follow a consistent style (the Air formatter automates this).

The code has an appropriate amount of comments.

- Comments are minimized by using meaningful variable names and helper functions.
- Comments are used to explain the why of code, not the what.
